**What is this Repository?**

![DistrictMap](https://github.com/akirawisnu/COVID-District-ID/blob/main/DALY-1.png?raw=true)

This repository will help researcher or any curious mind that want to explore or doing research for COVID related data in Indonesia. The advantage of this repository is due to:
* Usage of Free Open Data:
	* [Kawalcovid19](https://kawalcovid19.id/)
	* [KemenkesRI](https://www.kemkes.go.id/)
	* [Lantip](https://lantip.xyz/)
* Data is cleaned and ready for Analysis
	* Economist friendly data of .dta (Stata 11/12) format
	* Open delimited text data .csv for researcher and data scientist (Pipe or "|" symbol is being used as separator / delimiter instead comma (","))
	* Include MFD (Master File Data) to combine the Covid data with BPS and Kemendagri Dataset using their respective District ID (ID Kabupaten)
* Data is granular at District Level
	* District COVID Data is still rare and particularly hard to find
* Easy to map, use my other repository in case you don't have the necessary Shapefiles
	* [ShapefileID](https://github.com/akirawisnu/GIS_Shapefile_2020_ID)
* Updated Daily COVID Data (High Frequency Data)
	
In addition, you can find the study that I was doing in collaboration in Dr. Arianto Patunru of The Australian National University for FKP21, "Economic risks of COVID-19: a local perspective" in this repository.
